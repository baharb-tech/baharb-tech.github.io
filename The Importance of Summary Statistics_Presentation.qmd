## Introduction

-   Summary statistics are the **first step** in understanding any dataset.

-   They help us see:

    -   Typical values (mean, median)

    -   How data is spread (variance, SD)

    -   Patterns and anomalies

    -   Possible errors or outliers

-   In this presentation, I will explain:

    -   Why summary statistics are important

    -   The types of summary statistics

    -   Techniques to compute them in R

## Why Summary Statistics Matter

-   Summary statistics help us **quickly understand** large datasets.
-   They show:
    -   Central values (mean, median)
    -   Spread of data (range, variance, standard deviation)
    -   Distribution shape (skewness, kurtosis)
-   They help detect:
    -   Outliers\
    -   Incorrect values\
    -   Missing data\
    -   Data entry mistakes\
-   They make analysis **faster**, **simpler**, and **more accurate**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Types of Summary Statistics

### **1. Measures of Central Tendency**

-   **Mean** – average value\
-   **Median** – middle value\
-   **Mode** – most frequent value

### **2. Measures of Spread**

-   **Range** – difference between max and min\
-   **Variance** – how far values are from the mean\
-   **Standard Deviation** – average spread of data

### **3. Measures of Shape**

-   **Skewness** – direction of tilt\

-   **Kurtosis** – how peaked or flat the distribution is

---

### **4. Count & Frequency**

-   **Count of observations**\
-   **Frequency tables**

## Techniques to Compute Summary Statistics in R 
Base R: Simple Summary Statistics

### Example Dataset
Heights of 5 students:

~~~r
heights <- c(160, 165, 170, 155, 180)
~~~

### Base R Summary Statistics

~~~r
mean(heights)      # average height
median(heights)    # middle value
sd(heights)        # standard deviation
summary(heights)   # full summary
~~~

## dplyr Summary Statistics

```r
library(dplyr)

df <- data.frame(heights)

df %>%
  summarise(
    mean_height = mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_height = median(heights, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_height = sd(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

### Explanation
- `summarise()` creates new summary values.
- Each line inside summarise calculates one statistic.
- `na.rm = TRUE` removes missing values before calculation.

---

## Grouped Summary Statistics

```r
library(dplyr)

# Example dataset
df_grouped <- data.frame(
  group = c("A", "A", "B", "B", "B"),
  value = c(10, 12, 8, 15, 14)
)

# Grouped summary
df_grouped %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_value = mean(value),
    count     = n()
  )
```

### Explanation
- `group_by(group)` splits the dataset into categories (A and B).
- `summarise()` calculates summary statistics *inside each group*.
- This helps compare groups easily (e.g., group A vs group B).

## 🎯 Student Exercise: Try It Yourself

### Dataset  
Scores: **45, 60, 75, 80, 90**

### Your Tasks
- Calculate the **mean** of the scores  
- Find the **median**  
- Calculate the **standard deviation**  
- Use `summary(scores)` and observe the output  
- Bonus: Convert the scores into a data frame and print it  

### Questions to Discuss
- What does the mean tell you about these scores?  
- Are the values close together or widely spread?  
- Does the summary output match your manual calculations?

---

## ✅ Solution to the Exercise

### Dataset  
Scores: **45, 60, 75, 80, 90**

### Calculations
- **Mean:** 70  
- **Median:** 75  
- **Standard Deviation:** 17.08 (approx)  
- **Summary Output Includes:**  
  - Min = 45  
  - 1st Quartile = 60  
  - Median = 75  
  - Mean = 70  
  - 3rd Quartile = 80  
  - Max = 90  

### Data Frame Conversion
`scores_df <- data.frame(scores)`  
Creates a table with one column named *scores*.

### Interpretation
- The mean (70) represents the **average performance**.  
- The scores are **not extremely spread out** — SD is moderate.  
- The summary output matches all manual calculations.

## 📝 Conclusion

- Summary statistics provide a **quick understanding** of any dataset.  
- They help identify typical values, variation, and possible errors.  
- **Base R**, **dplyr**, and **grouped summaries** offer easy ways to compute them.  
- Summary statistics are essential before visualization or modeling.  
- With just a few lines of R code, we can extract **clear, meaningful insights** from data.
