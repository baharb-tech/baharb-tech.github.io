# 1. Introduction

Summary statistics provide a quick overview of a dataset.\
They help identify typical values, variation, and potential errors before deeper analysis.\
They form the foundation for understanding and preparing data in R.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Why Summary Statistics Matter

-   Understand central values\
-   See how spread out the data is\
-   Detect outliers and missing values\
-   Identify wrong or inconsistent entries\
-   Understand distribution shape\
-   Prepare data for modeling and further analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. Types of Summary Statistics

## A. Measures of Central Tendency

-   Mean\
-   Median\
-   Mode

## B. Measures of Spread

-   Range\
-   Variance\
-   Standard deviation

## C. Distribution Shape

-   Skewness\
-   Kurtosis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. Student Exercise

Dataset: **45, 60, 75, 80, 90**

Tasks: - Find the mean\
- Find the median\
- Find the standard deviation\
- Identify the minimum and maximum\
- Identify the quartiles\
- Write one sentence describing the spread of the data

Questions: - What does the mean tell you?\
- Are the values close together or spread apart?\
- What does the minimum and maximum represent?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. Solution (Summary)

-   Mean = 70\
-   Median = 75\
-   Standard deviation ≈ 17\
-   Minimum = 45\
-   Maximum = 90\
-   Interpretation:\
    The data shows moderate spread and increases gradually.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Conclusion

Summary statistics are essential for understanding the patterns in a dataset.\
They reveal the typical value, the variation, and the shape of the distribution.\
These insights make the analysis clearer and more reliable.
