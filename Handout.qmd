# 1. Introduction

Summary statistics help us understand a dataset quickly.  
They show typical values, variation, and possible errors.  
R provides simple tools to calculate these statistics in an efficient way.

---

# 2. Why Summary Statistics Matter

- Understand central values  
- See how spread out the data is  
- Detect outliers and missing values  
- Identify wrong or inconsistent entries  
- Understand distribution shape  
- Prepare data for further analysis

# 3. Types of Summary Statistics

## A. Measures of Central Tendency
- Mean  
- Median  
- Mode  

## B. Measures of Spread
- Range  
- Variance  
- Standard deviation  

## C. Distribution Shape
- Skewness  
- Kurtosis

# 4. Techniques Used in R

## A. Base R
- Built-in functions that calculate common summary values  
- Does not require additional packages  
- Suitable for small or simple datasets  

## B. dplyr (Tidyverse)
- Cleaner and easier to read  
- Supports summarising multiple variables  
- Handles missing values (`na.rm = TRUE`)  
- Very useful for larger datasets  

## C. Grouped Summaries
- Used to compare categories (e.g., groups, genders, regions)  
- Helps understand differences between categories

# 5. Student Exercise

Dataset: **45, 60, 75, 80, 90**

Tasks:
- Find the mean  
- Find the median  
- Find the standard deviation  
- Identify the minimum and maximum  
- Identify the quartiles  
- Write one sentence describing how spread out the scores are  

Questions:
- What does the mean tell you?  
- Are the values close together or spread apart?  
- What do the minimum and maximum show?  

---

# 6. Solution (Summary)

- Mean = 70  
- Median = 75  
- Standard deviation ≈ 17  
- Minimum = 45  
- Maximum = 90  
- Interpretation:  
  The data has moderate spread and the scores gradually increase.

# 7. Conclusion

Summary statistics are important because they help us understand data clearly and quickly.  
R provides simple methods using Base R and the dplyr package.  
These techniques form the foundation for reliable and accurate data analysis.
